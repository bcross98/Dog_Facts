	fact[0] = "Adult dogs have 42 permanent teeth.";
	fact[1] = "Dogs sweat through the pads on their feet.";
	fact[2] = "Dogs can actually see in multiple colors.";
	fact[3] = "Elizabeth II has had over 30 corgis since her accession in 1952.";
	fact[4] = "The Chihuahua is the smallest dog breed.";
	fact[5] = "Labradors were once called St. John's Newfoundland.";
	fact[6] = "Basenjis don't bark, instead they make a noise best described as a yodel.";
	fact[7] = "The name of the dog on the front of the Cracker Jack Box is Bingo.";
	fact[8] = "The most popular dog name of 2020 was Bella.";
	fact[9] = "The Labrador Retriever is the most popular breed of dog in the United States.";
	fact[10] = "Dogs have 3 eyelids.";
	fact[11] = "Dogs can smell thousands of times better than humans. Their noses have millions more scent receptors—for example, a human nose averages 5 million while a Dachshund’s nose has 125 million—making them useful in sniffing out drugs, dead bodies, bed bugs, explosives, and more.";
	fact[12] = "Dogs’ sense of smell might be pretty amazing, but don’t forget about their hearing! Everything from the positioning of their ears to the muscles in them helps them pick up a whole host of sounds that humans can’t pick up. In fact, the most popular explanation for why dogs tilt their heads is that they’re trying to locate the source of a sound.";
	fact[13] = "Dogs have approximately a sixth of the number of taste buds that humans have (1,700 taste buds to humans’ approximately 9,000). This is why dogs will scarf rotting food scraps as voraciously as they’ll eat a bowl of kibble or a hunk of steak. Their less discriminatory sense of taste also has to do with their evolutionary instincts, carried over from when they would scavenge in the wild.";
	fact[14] = "Dogs have approximately a sixth of the number of taste buds that humans have (1,700 taste buds to humans’ approximately 9,000). This is why dogs will scarf rotting food scraps as voraciously as they’ll eat a bowl of kibble or a hunk of steak. Their less discriminatory sense of taste also has to do with their evolutionary instincts, carried over from when they would scavenge in the wild.";
	fact[15] = "A dog’s nose is the equivalent of a human fingerprint, with each having a unique pattern of ridges and creases."
	fact[16] = "If you’ve ever noticed your pooch twitching in her sleep, this probably means she’s dreaming. Researchers found that dogs have similar sleep patterns and brain activity as humans, and that small breeds tend to dream more than large ones. Psychology Today suggests they’re probably imagining familiar activities like playing outside or chasing their tail.";
	fact[17] = "According to canine researcher and author Stanley Coren, your toddler and pup are about on par when it comes to brains. He also explained that man’s best friend can count, understand over 150 words, and even trick people or other dogs to get treats. Intelligence varies based on breed—Border collies are the smartest.";
	fact[18]= "Unspayed females only go into heat twice a year, so dog breeders need to plan carefully.";
	fact[19] = "If your dog excitedly wags its tail, it means they’re happy to see you, right? Not necessarily. According to Discovery.com, dogs wag their tails to the right when they’re happy and to the left when they’re frightened. Wagging low means they’re insecure, and rapid tail wagging accompanied by tense muscles or dilated pupils can signal aggression.";
	fact[20] = "Newborn dogs are still developing, according to Psychology Today, so their ear canals and eyes are still closed. Most puppies open their eyes and respond to noises after about two weeks.";
	fact[21] = "Even though they sweat out through the pads of their paws, their main form of cooling down is panting.";
    fact[22] = "Some pet owners might notice the faint scent of corn chips or popcorn lingering around their dog. This is called “Frito feet,” and it happens when sweat and bacteria build up in the paws.";
    fact[23] = "You might expect your dog’s mouth to smell like, well, dog. But persistent bad breath can actually be a sign of dental disease or other health problems. If you don’t already, have your dog’s teeth examined by a veterinarian every year.";
    fact[24] = "It’s no secret: dogs often eat their own feces (and other fecal matter). But though it might seem gross, the ASPCA says it’s perfectly normal, stemming from their pre-domestication days thousands of years ago. More common in puppies, older dogs usually grow out of it, although some do it into adulthood.";
    fact[25] = "Ever wonder why dogs like to twirl around before they do their business? Well, it’s one of the many dog behaviors that perplex researchers, but the prevailing theory is that it has to do with the Earth’s magnetic field. Dogs like to poop facing north or south, and spinning around helps them correctly orient their internal compasses.";
    fact[26] = "You’re not imagining it if you think your dog is acting jealous when you give other dogs attention,” says Nikki Naser, Resident Pet Expert at Chewy. “It might not be exactly how we experience jealousy, but research has shown that it’s similar to how an infant might get jealous.” That certainly tracks with dogs’ intelligence being on par with that of a toddler.";
    fact[27] = "Of course, you love your good boy or girl so much. But they actually don’t love it when you give them big bear hugs. “The way people show love is not the same way a dog shows love or wants to receive love,” says Russell Hartstein, CEO of the Los Angeles puppy training company Fun Paw Care. “In fact, it can be very stressful.” He says that dogs can adapt and become comfortable with loved ones doing it, but you should still be careful about giving hugs to a dog you don’t know well, and about letting strangers hug yours.";
    fact[28] = "This is one of the most common dog “facts” that are actually false. Despite a prevailing myth that dogs can only see in black and white, your pooch actually can see a spectrum of color. While they do have trouble distinguishing between different shades of green and red, which will mostly just appear as grays and browns, blue and yellow tones are relatively clear to them.";
    fact[29] = "Dogs are a protective species, and they understandably see a person coming near their house and placing unfamiliar objects in a box as a potential threat. And it’s often made worse, not better, by the fact that the mail carrier comes repeatedly; dogs figure out approximately when they arrive and then get riled up and antsy beforehand. To save your mail carrier from undue canine aggression, experts recommend being friendly to them, around your dog, so that your dog can see that you trust them. You can also let your mail carrier know what your dog’s name is so that he or she can properly address your dog.";
    fact[30] = "Don’t forget that dogs don’t experience the full breadth of emotions that humans do, so if you’re trying to train or admonish your dog, taking an angry tone and a very loud voice might just make him skittish. According to Hartstein, “your prosodic of speech, tone, rhythm, [and the] pitch of your voice is far more important” than what you’re actually saying. That’s also a big part of the reason why dogs respond positively to that high-pitched cute-pet speak.";
    fact[31] = "When your dog lets out a big yawn, you probably just assume it means what it does when we yawn—that he’s sleepy. And it certainly can be a sign of tiredness, but dogs yawn for other reasons as well. Dogs can also yawn to calm themselves down, so repeated yawns could be a sign that your pup is feeling anxious or stressed out. It’s similar to the way a cat’s purr can mean lots of different things, so assessing the context of the situation can usually help you figure out what’s going on.";
    fact[32] = "Media portrayals of these furry frenemies would have you believe that chasing cats is hard-wired in dogs’ DNA. But it’s not specific to cats; their evolutionary, hunting instincts are the reason they chase after anything small and speedy, whether it’s their favorite ball or little Tiger. But dogs and cats can actually get along great, even in the same household, depending on the animals themselves and whether you introduce the animals the right way.";
    fact[33] = "Dogs’ normal body temperature is slightly higher than that of humans (it hovers at around 101.5° F), which means that hotter temperatures can affect them more. This is why you need to take care while walking your dog on a hot day. Also, don’t forget about the pavement if you’re taking your dog for a walk—the ground heats up fast in the sun and can be painful on dogs’ unguarded feet. Not to mention, dogs have that thick layer of fur. So a day that may not seem overwhelmingly hot to you can be a scorcher for your dog.";
    fact[34] = "This is another of the fun facts about dogs that aren’t quite true. You probably grew up believing that the old “hold your hand out to an unfamiliar dog, let it smell you” advice was gospel. And it can work, but you have to be careful about how you do it. Just shoving your hand toward a strange dog’s face can scare or alienate her. You’re better off letting the dog approach you first and then offering your hand to the dog to smell, rather than assuming she wants to and waving your hand under her nose. And approach the dog from the side, rather than from straight on, if you must approach the dog yourself.";
    fact[35] = "Nope, every dog year does not automatically equal seven human years, as many fun facts about dogs would have you believe. The fact—which does have some factual merit—came from observations that “average,” medium-sized dogs tended to live around one-seventh as long as their owners. However, dogs come in all shapes and sizes, and what’s “average” for a Great Dane is very different from what’s “average” for a Chihuahua. Paying attention to the “life stages” of dogs, and how they correspond to each breed, gives you a much better picture of how old your dog actually is than equating one year to seven years.";
    fact[36] = "Despite enjoying considerable popularity for many years, the “dominance” theory of dog training is finally seeing the truth come out. “You should never try to dominate your dog,” Hartstein insists. The idea that you need to show your dog “who’s alpha,” with methods such as eating before your dog, making sure you’re always in a higher position than them, or punitive behavior, is outdated and ineffective. Of course, you need to set a routine and make sure your dog understands rules and boundaries, but avoid traditional advice about displays of dominance.";
    fact[37] = "You might think a lick to the face is your dog’s way of giving you a kiss. But that’s another popular dog fact that’s not quite true. “Kissing” isn’t a form of showing affection that comes naturally to dogs, so your snout-smooches may not be received as lovingly as you might think. If they lick your face—or make other motions like shifting their position, yawning, or licking their own lips—this could actually be a sign they want you to give them space, since having a face so close to their own could be viewed as aggressive or threatening. But, of course, dogs have been adapting to live with humans for thousands of years, and the Happy Puppy Site says that some dogs do catch on and learn to associate the kisses with affection.";
    fact[38] = "If the dog facts about dog kisses haven’t convinced you that dogs and humans use different forms of communication, the fact that butt-sniffing is a common dog greeting surely will. A dog’s unique smell is secreted in its glands, and yes, those scent glands are located in their backsides. Dogs’ rear ends are home to glands that produce pheromones, which contain information about everything from the sex of the dog to its health and diet. Thanks to dogs’ incredible senses of smell, they can learn all sorts of information about one another just from the nuances of the odor. So the butt-sniff is basically the dogs’ method of getting a first impression.";
    fact[39] = "You can find all sorts of research and fun facts about dogs and the health benefits of having one. And this factoid is true—petting a puppy can cause your blood pressure to drop around 10 percent. And, according to the American Kennel Club, the blood pressure of the dog being pet drops too.";
    fact[40] = "Ready for more weird anatomy-related fun facts about dogs? Dogs have three eyelids in each eye! In addition to a top and bottom lid, they have a “nictitating membrane” in the corner of their eye, primarily for removing dust and mucus from the cornea. And cats actually have it too! You might see it when your pet wakes up suddenly, as the membrane is shut when your pet sleeps.";
    fact[41] = "A Bloodhound has such a distinct and accurate sense of smell that it actually can be used as evidence in court. Their scent membranes permit the dog to differentiate smells at least one thousand times better than humans. Bloodhounds are commonly used in tracing missing persons and searching for criminals. They can follow tracks that are over 300 hours old and can remain on a trail for 130 miles.";
    fact[42] = "The Newfoundland breed has a water-resistant coat and webbed feet making them ideal for swimming. They were initially bred to help fishermen and rescue people from drowning. A few Newfoundland owners have even recounted their pups trying to “save” them while they’re swimming.";
    fact[43] = "We all know from earlier in this article that dogs can hear many sounds that humans can’t, and The Beatles used that to their advantage in their hit song, “A Day in the Life.” In an interview with Paul McCartney, he claimed that at the end of the song, a frequency was added that only dogs can hear. Play the song and watch your pup towards the end. Music is just as beneficial to dogs as it is to humans and can even help with a dog’s anxiety.";
    fact[44] = "Dogs can tell the difference between one hour and six hours. With enough conditioning and training, your dog will be able to forecast their daily activities such as walks and meals as long as they occur around the same time each day.";
    fact[45] = "Max the Golden Retriever became the very first mayor of a town in California called Idyllwild in 2012. Unfortunately, Mayor Max passed away in 2013, but was replaced by Mayor Max the II who has been in charge of the town ever since. As a non-incorporated town, there isn’t a human mayor, so Idyllwild Animal Rescue Friends (ARF) funded the first-ever election for Idyllwild. Any resident was able to nominate their pet leading to 14 dogs and two cats on the ballot. All votes cost one dollar and the proceeds went to support ARF. These aren’t the only animals who appeared on a ballot.";
    fact[46] = "Just like obesity is a health concern in humans, it’s also a major concern for dogs. More than half of the dogs in the United States are overweight, a number that has been continually on the rise for years because of too many calories, too little exercise, and consuming the food scraps of humans. Obesity can domino into other health problems for your dog and may consequently shorten their lifespan.";
    fact[47] = "In 1912, three dogs survived the sinking of the historical Titanic. All three were members of the first-class cabin: two Pomeranians and one Pekingese. According to historian J. Joseph Edgette, they most likely survived due to their size and not at the expense of any human passengers.";
    fact[48] = "Recorded in the Guinness Book of World Records, the oldest dog ever was an Australian Cattle Dog named Bluey. He lived to be 29 years and 5 months old from the years 1910 to 1939. Bluey lived in Victoria, Australia with his owner Les Hall and worked among his sheep and cattle. ";
    fact[49] = "It’s pretty common knowledge that dogs can’t eat chocolate, but have you ever wondered why? Chocolate contains an ingredient called theobromine which dogs are unable to digest. Consumption of chocolate could create a brutally toxic buildup in their system which could ultimately be deadly. So keep your pup out of the pantry!";
    fact[50] = "Dogs don’t curl up in a ball when they sleep just for cuteness points. They essentially curl up due to a biological instinct to protect their vital organs and keep themselves warm.";
    fact[51] = "Basenjis don’t bark, but they definitely don’t remain totally silent. Some describe the sounds a Basenji makes as a howl, but others say it’s more like a yodel. Shrieks and screams have actually led to police knocking on the door of Basenji owners preparing to rescue someone in danger.";
    fact[52] = "Dogs have an amazing sense of vocabulary, with the ability to learn over 1,000 words! For example, a Border Collie named Chaser knows both nouns and verbs and can understand them enough to shape an action. Research on the subject is in full swing with programs dedicated to dog psychology at major universities such as Duke University, Yale University, and Barnard College.";
	fact[53] = "The Saluki served as the hunting hound of kings for thousands of years. They are a slim breed, but incredibly strong with impeccable balance. This breed is very independent but will always remain loyal to their family.";
    fact[54] = "Dogs initially left a bad taste in Thomas Jefferson’s mouth because they usually helped themselves to people’s sheep and livestock. Jefferson began to tax dog owners due to the high price of wool. The more dogs someone owned, the higher the tax. But after serving as minister to France and reading writings from those he admired with dogs, he began his search for his own pup, ending up with a Briard named Buzzy.";
    fact[55] = "More than half of U.S. presidents have owned at least one dog, if not multiple dogs. Calvin Coolidge owned at least 12!";
    fact[56] = "Many veterinarians and breeders agree that between 7-8 weeks is the most ideal time to bring a puppy home for the first time. The largest factor in this decision is the puppy’s socialization period which usually occurs during weeks 6-12. This period of time is when the puppy is learning the norms of everyday life. It’s best for dogs to enter their new home during this time so they can adapt to their new environment.";
    fact[57] = "In 1969, Lassie was the first animal inducted into the Animal Hall of Fame. Lassie is a fictional dog created by Eric Knight. Lassie began as the star of a short story that was later expanded into a full-length novel, Lassie Come-Home. The book was adapted into a feature film and “Lassie” has appeared in several other feature films through 1951, followed by a long-running TV show called Lassie.";
    fact[58] = "Stray dogs have mastered the art of the complex Metro in Moscow, Russia. They have been seen to get on and off at regular stops in search of food. The commuters have become so used to seeing the dogs riding the train with them that they barely notice anymore. As many as 35,000 stray dogs live in Moscow so this is truly a case of survival of the fittest.";
    fact[59] = "There are many breeds of dogs that look like wolves, but did you know that all the dogs we love today have descended from the wild wolf? Wolves would certainly not make a good pet and while wolf-dog hybrids do exist, they are only recommended for experienced dog owners.";
    fact[60] = "It’s a challenge to estimate how many dogs currently live around the world, but according to the most recent estimations, there are approximately 900 million. About 75-85 percent of those dogs are considered free-range, meaning they are not owned by humans and an estimated 200 million dogs are strays according to the World Health Organization. With many countries requiring pets to be registered, the country with the most pet dogs is France with a dog to human ratio of 17 to 100.";
    fact[61]= "Scientists believe that the world’s first known dog lived 31,700 years ago. This prehistoric dog resembled a large Siberian Husky.";
